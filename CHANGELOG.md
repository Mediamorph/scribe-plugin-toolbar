# 1.0.0

Allows a single toolbar to be shared amongst multiple scribes. This behaviour is controlled through the new options paramter that changes the signature of the module (hence the major version bump).

While I've put together the final package this contribution came primarily from [Shihab Uddin](https://github.com/shihabuddin), thanks for contributing the code and also sticking through the slightly prolonged release process.

# 0.2.2

Removes the post-install hook as it was causing issues to be reported in other build systems.

# 0.2.1

Button clicks have been changed to 'mousedown' events to try and avoid focus issues. Thank you (madjor5)[https://github.com/madjor5]

# 0.2.0

Command values can now be passed through from the buttons. Thanks [bigdave](https://github.com/bigdave)

# 0.1.5

Toolbars shouldn't need to consist of button elements anymore
